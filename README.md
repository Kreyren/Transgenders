## Who are transgenders?

[Gender dysphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria) has been observed on humanoids who are in a distress as a result of their gender identity (gender that they feel like they are) in a relation to the gender that they have been born with.
This mental disorder is known to cause eating disorders, depression, anxiety, social isolation and in worst cases suicide(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria#cite_note-Davidson-2012-4).

Most of the transgenders are suffering from a gender dysphoria, but not all of them are recognized as mentally ill since they are do not meet the requirements to be considered as such and are capable of living as regular non-transgeder humanoids in our sociaty as explained in an official statement from World Health Organization (https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/05/27/new-health-guidelines-propel-transgender-rights) which is made to make their lives in our sociaty possible and sustainable.

## Known treatment

Humanoids with gender dysphoria were considered as mentally ill and they were forced into a mandatory consultation with a psychiatrist or locked in a mental hospital which only worsen the symptoms and increased the risk of suicide (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria#Classification_as_a_disorder).

Nowadays the treatment is to allow them in our society and treated as a gender that they are more comfortable with which may include a cross-dressing.
Some transgenders are opting for a gender surgery to make their bodies look more like their desired gender which shown a mental improvement and reduced the risk of self-harm and suicide (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender#Mental_healthcare).
